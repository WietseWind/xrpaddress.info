No more mistakes entering destination tags 🎉

A website to explain the new [XRPL Tagged Address Codec](https://npmjs.org/package/xrpl-tagged-address-codec), packing XRPL destination addresses and destination tags into one `X`-address.

I'll add some content to this website, allowing users, consumers, exchanges, developers, etc. to encode and decode addresses, and learn more about the address format.
